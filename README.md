# Muru - Your Virtual Pet Adventure

A project for the Junction2023 Hackathon tackling the Huawei challenge

## Overview

Welcome to "Muru" the next generation of virtual pet games! Muru takes the concept of virtual pets to a whole new level, combining the best elements of Tamagotchi and Pokémon Go, and then adding unique features that make it truly exceptional.

## Features

### Real-Life Interaction

Muru is not your ordinary virtual pet. It's a game that seamlessly integrates with your daily activities. Here's why Muru is better than traditional virtual pet games:

- **Real-World Impact**: Muru's pets are not just digital entities; they are influenced by your real-life actions. Take a walk, go for a jog, or explore the outdoors, and your pet will grow, develop, and change.

- **Dynamic Pet Behavior**: Muru pets adapt to your daily routine. They love to accompany you on your adventures and thrive on your healthy lifestyle. Neglect them, and they'll let you know.

- **Pets with Personality**: Each pet in Muru has its own unique personality. They communicate with you and express their feelings. They laugh, play, and sometimes even sulk – just like real pets.

- **Ensuring healthy lifestyles**:Forgot to keep hydrated? Haven't eaten enough? Your Muru will remind you, they drink when you drink and eat when you do!

### OpenAI GPT-Based Chatbot

One of the standout features of Muru is its pets' ability to talk to their users. We've harnessed the power of the OpenAI GPT-based chatbot to create a dynamic and engaging conversation between you and your virtual companion.

- **Natural Conversations**: Your pet can hold natural and interesting conversations with you, making the game feel more immersive.

- **Endless Entertainment**: Enjoy interactive discussions, share stories, and even seek advice from your pet, just as you would with a real friend.

### The Best of Both Worlds

Muru is the perfect blend of Tamagotchi's nurturing experience and Pokémon Go's adventure and exploration. It offers:

- **Nurturing and Bonding**: Take care of your pet, watch them grow, and create a strong emotional bond as you interact with them daily.

- **Adventure Awaits**: Explore the virtual world of Muru, engage in fun quests, and discover exciting surprises along the way.


### Challenge your friends

Think your Muru is big and strong? Challenge your friends in an epic battle simulator. Your pets' abilities grow the more you train, and the battle ensures that you have to keep moving.

- Each pet gets a set of actions bought by their users with spent action points (action points are earned with exploration and an active healthy lifestyle)
- When both players pick an action, a fun sport challenge is set, the first one to complete the challenge gets to attack first
- After dealing enough damage the battle ends and the pet left standing is victorious
- But don't worry, your Muru will be healthy and well after and ready for even more adventures.
